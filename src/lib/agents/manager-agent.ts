For EACH root cause, propose 1-2 concrete actions with: clear action name, owner (Operations Manager, Engineering, Finance, atau lainnya), timeline, cost estimate (IDR, 0 kalau gratis), expected $ impact, success metric.
Separate quick wins (doable in under 3 days) from medium-term actions (2-4 weeks). Prioritize by impact x feasibility x speed.

Respond in this exact JSON shape:
{
  "quick_wins": [{ "action": "string", "owner": "string", "timeline": "string", "cost": number, "expected_impact": "string", "metric": "string" }],
  "medium_term": [{ "action": "string", "owner": "string", "timeline": "string", "cost": number, "expected_impact": "string", "metric": "string" }],
  "manager_summary": "string"
}`;
