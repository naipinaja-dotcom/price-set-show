${average4week ? `- Revenue: ${average4week.total_revenue}\n- Total Cost: ${average4week.total_cost}` : "(belum cukup histori snapshot)"}

Incidents This Week:
${JSON.stringify(incidents)}

Analyze this data and provide:
1. Week-over-week changes ($ and %) for revenue, cost, and margin
2. Deviation vs 4-week average (%)
3. Key anomalies and correlations between incidents and the numbers
4. Summary for the next agent (root-cause analyst)

If previous week or 4-week average isn't available, use 0 for the numeric comparison fields and say so in worker_summary — do not invent numbers.
